# CLAUDE.md — sdrcore (Pi servers)

Claude's notes for the Pi servers `sdrcore-recv`, `sdrcore-trans` and `ms-sdr`
(Proficio / MSCC station). Owner: **Ron (W4MMP)**. Grok follows `AGENTS.md`; this
file is for Claude only.

## Working with Ron

- Short, plain-English answers. Say what is verified and what isn't.
- **"stop" means stop immediately.**
- Ask before large or risky changes. Commit / push **only when asked**,
  `git add` specific paths only (Grok and other tools work in this repo too).

## Folder rules

| Path | Rule |
|---|---|
| `rpi/SDRcore-recv-linux/`, `rpi/SDRcore-trans-linux/`, `rpi/ms-sdr-linux/` | **Working trees** (Pi source of truth). Claude edits here. |
| Rest of `C:\Users\Ron\.grok\worktrees` | Read-only reference unless Ron says otherwise. |

History: Claude worked in a copy `rpi/sdrcore-claude/` (commits fe0c9a1, 0443c21,
9bb4be2, 4cb8b74). On 2026-09-25 Ron had the changes moved back into the originals
(originals unchanged since 8dee14a) and the copy deleted.
Git repo root: `C:\Users\Ron\.grok\worktrees`.

## Architecture (per Ron)

WPF client (Windows) <-> **ms-sdr** (controller, UDP :8888) <-> **sdrcore-recv** (:9000)
and **sdrcore-trans** (:9200). ms-sdr is the only interface between the client and the
two DSP cores. ms-sdr is also the **radio controller** (talks to the radio hardware
directly; CAT, USB, keyer code live there). Other ports in ms-sdr `port_defines.h`:
8889 MSCC, 9600 panadapter, 9700 spectrum, 9800 waterfall.
Remote audio: client mic -> sdrcore-trans UDP 9101 (MSA1); sdrcore-recv -> client
phones UDP 9100 (MSA1). CW is not part of remote audio.

## Build (on the Pi, arm64)

```bash
cd rpi/SDRcore-recv-linux  && make clean && make
cd ../SDRcore-trans-linux  && make clean && make
cd ../ms-sdr-linux         && make clean && make
```

`make` installs to `~/mscc/` (replaces the running binary; `BINDIR=...` to avoid).
See also `rpi/mscc-deb/BUILD-SERVERS-ON-PI.md`.
Syntax check on Windows: WSL `Debian` has gcc. Use `-iquote sources -idirafter sources`
(plain `-I sources` pulls in the Windows `pthread.h` and fails).

## Ron confirmed (not issues)

Overdrive code is legacy, ignore it. CW carrier is generated continuously (keyed
elsewhere). No thread locking is fine (works for years).

## Changes (2026-09-25)

sdrcore-trans:
1. `udp_thread.c` `CMD_SET_IQ_BAND`: unknown band ignored (was `G_iq_stack[200]` write).
2. `udp_thread.c` `CMD_SET_BAND_POWER_POWER`: `Get_Power_Mode_Index()` maps wire mode
   (0 AM,1 LSB,2 USB,3 CW,4 TUNE,5 FM) to table slot (USB,LSB,AM,CW,TUNE,FM).
3. `driver.c`: USB/LSB always use USB_POWER/LSB_POWER (Stew's 3ec263a had digital on
   TUNE_POWER). **Verified on air**: full power, follows SSB slider.
4. `dsputils.c`: local DIGITAL_AUDIO (0) back on analog gain (6.324 stereo); remote
   modes 2/3 stay 2.5. Digital mic gain slider needs turning down.
5. `remote_mic.c`: smooth +/-300 ppm fill trim toward 100 ms (was 0.8 %/2.4 % pitch
   steps); prime/resync/re-prime. No file I/O in the audio callback; receiver thread
   logs EVENTs (hold_last reprime, resync, primed, overflow, udp_gap). **Remote audio
   verified on air** 2026-09-26: 30 m FT8 QSO, bad/under/overflow 0, no EVENTs,
   occ ~5020 (~105 ms), step 0.500020, peak ~14250 TX.
6. `main.c`: remote ring drained during TUNE (split streams); mic ring drift-safe (see 8).

sdrcore-recv:
7. `udp_thread.c`: `CMD_SET_IQ_BAND` bounds; phones/digital volume ATTN separate per
   audio mode; after CW TX reopen output for the current mode.
8. `main.c` (and trans mic ring): dual-stream ring primes to 64 ms, +/-300 ppm trim,
   resync, silence + re-prime on underrun (was ~21 ms dropout every few minutes).
9. `panadapter.c`: smoothing = true average of n frames in 32 bits, clamped 1..4
   (was n+1/n in uint16, overflow at 4). Pan levels shift; client dB CAL may need redoing.

Status: recv + ring fixes built on the Pi and working in Ron's first tests.

mscc-init-linux (2026-09-26):
10. `main.c` `init_mscc`: rewrites only its own keys, keeps other `mscc.ini` lines, and adds
    `SWR_METER=1`, `SWR_METER_PORT=6999`, `SWR_METER_TO_GUI=1` if missing (calibration had
    wiped them). Syntax-checked in WSL; not built/run on the Pi yet.
11. `mscc-init-gui/mscc_init_gui/config.py` `write_mscc_ini`: same keep + SWR defaults.
    Tested with Windows Python (existing and new file). Shared `_all.deb` with Ubuntu (Ron OK'd).
    File is `~/.local/mscc/mscc.ini` (not `~/mscc.ini`).
12. `mscc-init-gui` 1.0.15: volume GUI dropped (Ron: didn't work out); postinst removes
    old `~/mscc/mscc-volume-gui`. Build with `build-deb.sh` in WSL from an LF copy (repo
    files are CRLF); the `.ps1` builder is stale. `mscc.sh` skips volume restore if absent.

## On hold (Ron, 2026-09-26): cmd-042 (from pull f9efa00, 2026-09-25)

Windows `mscc-recv` 3.141 added 0xD1 CMD_SET_BW_HICUT index 5 = 1400 Hz, 6 = 1000 Hz
(DIG-U Hi, WPF cmd-041). Pi to match in `SDRcore-recv-linux/sources/udp_thread.c`
(hi-cut switch ~line 1547) + version bump -> `mscc_1.0.46_arm64.deb` (1.0.45 used 2026-09-26 for the recv/trans fixes). Brief:
`.mscc-coord/briefs/cmd-042.md`. Order: after ubuntu-stew is done and Stew pushes.
Reviewed: 0-4 unchanged, low-cut max 500 < 1000, ms-sdr passes index through. Not done yet.

## To do: RF check of remote TX audio (Stew, spectrum analyzer)

FT8 QSOs don't prove a clean signal (FT8 tolerates dropouts/pitch steps). Check:
- Single tone (FT8 or steady whistle): one clean line; sidebands/spurs = ring stepping or dropouts.
- Two-tone: IMD (3rd/5th) for overdrive; digital mic gain slider still high (see 4).
- TX on/off edges: no key-up/key-down splatter.
- Full 13 s FT8 over: no frequency jumps or wobble.
- Same test local vs remote audio; a difference points at the remote path.
If bad: `grep "remote_mic EVENT" ~/sdrcore-trans.log` for the same time.

## Open: RX low-edge hash (sdrcore-recv, not fixed)

Seen 2026-09-26 in local digital audio (WSJT-X Wide Graph): ~300 Hz band of hash just
above the RX low-cut. Moves with low-cut (500 -> hash at 500-800), same width. Present
on dummy load and in LSB. Not seen in remote: the two back-to-back USB audio adapters
(analog) add a noise floor that hides it. Very weak; phones/on-air likely unaffected.
Not from our changes (`sdrcore.c` untouched).

Likely cause (analysis, not proven): `sdrcore.c` `fastconv` uses a real (two-sided)
`wsfirBP` filter plus hard FFT-bin zeroing for opposite-sideband removal. The hard cut
at 0 Hz makes the effective filter longer than FILTERTAPS (2048), so overlap-save
wraps around between blocks; the error lands at the lowest passed frequencies, width
set by block length (~21 ms), not by the filter.

Possible fix (USB/LSB only; AM/FM keep the real filter): one-sided complex filter.
Lowpass of half-width (high-low)/2, multiplied by e^(j*2*pi*fc*n/fs), fc = (low+high)/2
(negative for LSB); load complex taps into `filt` (hfilt must become complex) in
`initDSP`; drop the bin zeroing. Verify before/after on a dummy load.
